# About Me

I am a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer science. I am advised by
[Irfan Essa](http://prof.irfanessa.com) and [Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/).  I also have the
pleasure of working closely with
[Devi Parkih](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/).  My research interests are
primarily focused on computer vision and its applications to understanding.  In particular, I am interested in working on
tackling problems involving 3D perception and general scene understanding.


In the summer of 2018, I was a research intern at facebook Reality Labs (FRL) and facebook AI Research (FAIR) working with
[Julian Straub](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jstraub/) and Dhruv Batra.

As an undergraduate, I participated in a 3-2 engineering program with [Juniata College](https://www.juniata.edu)
and [Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)](https://wustl.edu).
While I was at WUSTL, I
worked with [Yasu Furukawa](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~furukawa/) (now at SFU).  I spent a summer at Lehigh University and
worked with [Yinzhi Cao](http://www.yinzhicao.org).
