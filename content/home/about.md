# About Me

I received my PhD in computer science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022. I was advised by
[Irfan Essa][IS] and [Dhruv Batra][DB] and had the
pleasure of working closely with
[Devi Parikh][DP].  My research interests are
primarily focused on computer vision and its applications to artificial intelligence.
My long-term research goal is to develop fundamental techniques, algorithms, 
and large-scale systems for robotic assistants (i.e. Alexa with eyes and limbs).
My work focuses on training virtual robots (embodied agents) in simulation and transferring the skills learned to reality
to overcome the challenges of real-world training (its slow, and expensive).


In the summer of 2020, I was an intern at Intel working with [Vladlen Koltun][VK].
In the summer of 2019, I was an
intern at FAIR, working with [Manolis Savva][MS].
In the summer of 2018, I was a research intern at Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) working with
[Julian Straub][JS].

As an undergraduate, I participated in a 3-2 engineering program with [Juniata College][JC]
and [Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)][WUSTL].
While I was at WUSTL, I
worked with [Yasu Furukawa][YF] (now at SFU).  I also spent a summer
working with [Yinzhi Cao][YC] (now at JHU)
at Lehigh University.


I also have the pleasure of mentoring two students, [Joel Ye][JY] (1st year MS@GT) and [Guillermo Nicolas Grande][NG] (1st year MS@GT), in research projects.
