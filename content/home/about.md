# About Me

I am a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer science. I am advised by
[Irfan Essa][IS] and [Dhruv Batra][DB] and have the
pleasure of working closely with
[Devi Parikh][DP].  My research interests are
primarily focused on computer vision and its applications to artificial intelligence.
My long-term research goal is to develop fundamental techniques, algorithms, 
and large-scale systems for robotic assistants (i.e. Alexa with eyes and limbs).
My work focuses on training virtual robots (embodied agents) in simulation and transferring the skills learned to reality
to overcome the challenges of real-world training (its slow, and expensive).


In the summer of 2019, I was an
intern at FAIR, working with [Manolis Savva][MS] and continuing my on-going
collaboration with FRL.
In the summer of 2018, I was a research intern at Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) and Facebook AI Research (FAIR) working with
[Julian Straub][JS] and [Dhruv Batra][DB].

As an undergraduate, I participated in a 3-2 engineering program with [Juniata College][JC]
and [Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)][WUSTL].
While I was at WUSTL, I
worked with [Yasu Furukawa][YF] (now at SFU).  I also spent a summer at Lehigh University where I
worked with [Yinzhi Cao][YC] (now at JHU).
