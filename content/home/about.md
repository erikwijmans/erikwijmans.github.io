# About Me

I am a first year PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer science. I work closely with
[Irfan Essa](http://prof.irfanessa.com), [Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/), and
[Devi Parkih](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/).  My research interests are
primarily focused on computer vision and its applications to understanding.  In particular, I am interested in working on
tackling problems involving 3D perception and general scene understanding.

As an undergraduate, I participated in a 3-2 engineering program with Juniata College and WUSTL.  While I was at WUSTL, I
worked with [Yasu Furukawa](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~furukawa/) (now at SFU).  I spent a summer at Lehigh University and
worked with [Yinzhi Cao](http://www.yinzhicao.org).
