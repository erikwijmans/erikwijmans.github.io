# About Me

I am a research scientist at Apple working with [Vladlen Koltun][VK].
I received my PhD in computer science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022. I was advised by
[Irfan Essa][IS] and [Dhruv Batra][DB] and had the
pleasure of working closely with
[Devi Parikh][DP].  My research interests are
primarily focused on computer vision and its applications to artificial intelligence.
My long-term research goal is to develop fundamental techniques, algorithms, 
and large-scale systems for robotic assistants.
My work focuses on training virtual robots (embodied agents) in simulation and transferring the skills learned to reality
to overcome the challenges of real-world training (its slow, and expensive).


In the summer of 2020, I was an intern at Intel working with [Vladlen Koltun][VK].
In the summer of 2019, I was an
intern at FAIR, working with [Manolis Savva][MS].
In the summer of 2018, I was a research intern at Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) working with
[Julian Straub][JS].

As an undergraduate, I participated in a 3-2 engineering program with [Juniata College][JC]
and [Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)][WUSTL].
While I was at WUSTL, I
worked with [Yasu Furukawa][YF] (now at SFU).  I also spent a summer
working with [Yinzhi Cao][YC] (now at JHU)
at Lehigh University.


During my PhD, had the pleasure of mentoring two students, [Joel Ye][JY] (1st year MS@GT) and [Guillermo Nicolas Grande][NG] (1st year MS@GT), in research projects.
